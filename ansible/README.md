# Spur — Ansible Deployment

Playbooks for the whole cluster lifecycle:

- **`deploy.yml`** — stands up a Spur cluster in any supported shape from your inventory.
- **`rolling_upgrade.yml`** — upgrades a running cluster's binaries with no full-cluster outage.
- **`teardown.yml`** — stops the cluster.
- Day-2 [admin operations](#admin-operations) — `manage_accounts.yml`, `add_nodes.yml`, `remove_nodes.yml`, `healthcheck.yml`.

Daemons run as **systemd services**, Slurm-compatible CLI names are symlinked, and optional **PostgreSQL accounting** (embedded in `spurctld`) is on by default.

## Quick start

Run everything from this repo's `ansible/` directory.

`spur` (the upstream source) is a separate repo. Clone and build it wherever's convenient, then point `spur_binary_src` straight at the build output — no need to copy it anywhere.

> The role only ever reads the named files `spur`/`spurctld`/`spurd`/`spurstepd` out of that directory — `spurstepd` only when the build provides one, since builds before it shipped none. The MPI PMIx plugin (`spur_mpi_pmix.so`) is installed separately on agents by the `spur_agent` role (see [Build prerequisites](#build-prerequisites)).

```bash
# 1. Build spur (picks up mainline changes not yet in a tagged release; see Build prerequisites)
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/spur.git && cd spur
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y && source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
sudo apt install -y protobuf-compiler build-essential
cargo build --release -p spur-cli -p spurctld -p spurd -p spur-stepd
SPUR_BUILD="$(pwd)/target/release"
cd -

# 2. Ansible + inventory
python3 -m pip install --user 'ansible-core>=2.14'
cp inventory/hosts.example.ini inventory/hosts.ini
$EDITOR inventory/hosts.ini

# 3. Deploy
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_binary_src="$SPUR_BUILD"

# Without PostgreSQL accounting (jobs still run, sacct/fairshare unavailable):
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_binary_src="$SPUR_BUILD" -e spur_accounting_enabled=false
```

> **Dedicated accounting node:** to run PostgreSQL on its own host (not a controller or agent), just add that host to a `[spur_accounting_node]` group in your inventory — the playbook auto-detects it, so the deploy command is unchanged (no `-e` needed). That host runs only Postgres (no spur daemons), and every controller connects to it remotely. See [Accounting](#accounting-postgresql-embedded-in-spurctld) for the inventory layout.

A few things to know:

- **Where Postgres runs:** by default (no `spur_accounting_host` set) it runs on the **first controller**, which is fine for most clusters. See [Accounting](#accounting-postgresql-embedded-in-spurctld) for the dedicated-node inventory layout and details.
- **Verify with a real test job is opt-in** (`-e spur_verify_enabled=true`) — off by default so routine deploys don't add job noise; check `spur nodes` yourself, or enable it to have the playbook submit and confirm one.
- **Your real inventory is git-ignored** (see `.gitignore`) — only `inventory/*.example.ini` templates are tracked.

| Shape | Inventory pattern | Transport |
|---|---|---|
| Single-node | one host in **both** `spur_controllers` and `spur_agents` | local loopback |
| Multi-node — direct LAN | one host in `spur_controllers`, all compute in `spur_agents` | LAN IP, unencrypted |
| Multi-node — WireGuard mesh | as above + `spur_transport=wireguard` | encrypted mesh on `spur0` |
| HA — multi-controller Raft | **≥ 3 hosts** in `spur_controllers` (any number in `spur_agents`); auto-enabled | direct or wireguard |
| HA — separate compute | `spur_controllers` and `spur_agents` are **disjoint** host sets | direct or wireguard |

`deploy.yml` is idempotent — re-running it on a healthy cluster restarts daemons but preserves each host's existing `spur.conf` (see [below](#variables-defaults-in-inventorygroup_varsallyml)), unless you pass `-e spur_overwrite_conf=true`.

## Build prerequisites

You have two options: use a published release, or build the binaries yourself.

**Option A — use a published release (no build needed).** ROCm/spur now publishes releases. Check **https://github.com/ROCm/spur/releases** for the latest tag. If a release covers what you need, just omit `spur_binary_src` and the playbook runs upstream `install.sh` to download the binaries for you. By default it installs `spur_version: latest`; set `nightly` for a build off the mainline branch, or pin a specific `vX.Y.Z`.

**Option B — build locally** (the Quick start path above). Worth it when you need mainline changes not yet in a tagged release, an air-gapped install, or a custom patch. Build on a machine matching your targets' architecture/libc — the lab targets are Ubuntu 22.04 x86-64. You don't need to match the Rust version by hand: the first time you run `cargo` in the repo, rustup auto-selects the toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`.

> Already have Rust from somewhere other than rustup (distro package, asdf, …)? Compare `rustc --version` against `rust-toolchain.toml`'s `channel`. A mismatch can fail the build in ways that don't look version-related.

A local build produces four binaries under `target/release/`:

| Binary | Role |
|---|---|
| `spur` | multi-call CLI, symlinked to 18 Slurm-compatible names (`sbatch`, `squeue`, `sacct`, `sacctmgr`, `scontrol`, `salloc`, `srun`, `sinfo`, `scancel`, `sattach`, `scrontab`, `sdiag`, `smd`, `sprio`, `sreport`, `sshare`, `sstat`, `strigger`) |
| `spurctld` | controller / scheduler / Raft — also serves accounting in-process on the same gRPC port when `[accounting].database_url` is set |
| `spurd` | node agent |
| `spurstepd` | per-(job, step) supervisor the agent spawns — see [spurstepd](#spurstepd-the-job-supervisor) |

> `spurstepd` is newer than the other three. A pinned older release ships none, which is fine; what is **not** fine is a build that expects one where the binary is missing. Don't drop `-p spur-stepd` from the `cargo build` above.

Release and nightly tarballs from [ROCm/spur](https://github.com/ROCm/spur/releases) also ship `lib/spur/spur_mpi_pmix.so`. The playbooks install it on **agents only** at `/usr/lib/spur/` (matches `spurd`'s default plugin path). For a local build, also run `cargo build --release -p spur-mpi-pmix` and stage `target/release/libspur_mpi_pmix.so` (or rename to `spur_mpi_pmix.so`) in `spur_binary_src`. PMIx jobs (`--mpi=pmix`) additionally require `libpmix` and Open MPI on agent hosts — the playbooks do not install those packages.

> A pre-merge build (before upstream folded `spurdbd` into `spurctld`) also produces a `spurdbd` binary. It's harmless sitting alongside the others — the role only ever reads `spur`/`spurctld`/`spurd`/`spurstepd` by exact name.

**Every host gets the `spur` CLI + Slurm symlinks.** Agent-only hosts (in `[spur_agents]` but not `[spur_controllers]`/`[spur_login]`) also get `spurd` and `spurstepd`; controllers also get `spurctld` (and the agent pair too if also an agent). Only `spurctld` (the controller daemon) is host-specific — the CLI is everywhere so `squeue`/`sinfo`/etc. work locally on any node.

### spurstepd, the job supervisor

`spurstepd` supervises one `(job, step)` each. `spurd` spawns them detached — their own session, reparented to init — so they own the job's process tree, cgroup and exit status, and keep running across an `spurd` restart or upgrade; the restarted agent re-adopts them. Three things follow, and the playbooks handle all three:

- **It must live in the same directory as `spurd`** (`spur_install_dir`). The agent resolves it beside its own executable and **does not search `$PATH`**, so a node without it fails *every* job launch. `spur_install` copies it from the same source as `spurd`, in the same task, so the pair always comes from one build — a supervisor written by one build is not adopted by another. It participates in the same checksum comparison, so an unchanged re-run stays a no-op.
- **The `spurd` unit sets `KillMode=process`.** Supervisors detach from the agent but remain in its cgroup, so systemd's default (`control-group`) would kill them on every stop or restart and silently defeat the feature.
- **Each agent gets its own session directory**, `spur_agent_state_dir` (default `{{ spur_home }}/agent-state`), passed as `SPUR_STEPD_STATE_DIR` in the unit. Deliberately not `{{ spur_home }}/state`, which is the controller's Raft directory: a host running both daemons must not have them share one. The environment variable is used rather than `spurd --state-dir` because a build that predates `spurstepd` ignores an unknown variable but refuses to start on an unknown flag.

Builds before `spurstepd` existed ship no such binary, so its absence is a prominent **warning**, not an error. On a cluster whose build does ship it, set `-e spur_require_stepd=true` to make a missing `spurstepd` a hard failure in `spur_install` and a reported problem in `healthcheck.yml`.

`teardown.yml` and `remove_nodes.yml` reap supervisors explicitly — "stop `spurd`" does not, by design. See [Tear down](#tear-down).

Omit `spur_binary_src` and the playbook falls back to downloading a published release via upstream `install.sh` instead (see [Build prerequisites](#build-prerequisites)).

## Ansible control node

The control node is wherever you run `ansible-playbook` — your workstation is fine, and it doesn't need to join the cluster.

WireGuard transport needs two extra dependencies on the control node — the `ansible.utils` collection and `netaddr`:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
python3 -m pip install --user netaddr
```

Target hosts need: SSH reachable, sudo or root, `systemd`, and — only for the `install.sh` fallback — `curl` + `tar`.

- Every play runs with `become: true`, so a non-root `ansible_user` with passwordless sudo (or `ansible_become_password` supplied) works the same as `ansible_user=root`. This is required: `spur_home`/`spur_install_dir` default under `/root`, which a non-root user can't write to without becoming root.
- Password-based SSH works too — set `ansible_user`/`ansible_password` (via `sshpass`) in `[all:vars]` or per-host. `ansible.cfg` deliberately omits `-o BatchMode=yes`. That flag suppresses SSH's password prompt outright and silently breaks password auth even when `sshpass` is supplying the answer.

---

## Example commands per scenario

Every deploy uses the same base command; pick the inventory that matches your setup and add any extra flags from the table below.

```
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i <inventory> -e spur_binary_src=<path> [extra flags]
```

| Scenario | Inventory | Extra flags |
|---|---|---|
| Single-node | `inventory/single.ini` | *(none)* |
| Multi-node, direct LAN | `inventory/multi.ini` | *(none)* |
| HA, hyperconverged | `inventory/ha.ini` | *(none)* |
| HA, separate compute | `inventory/ha-separate.ini` | *(none)* |
| No accounting (jobs still run, `sacct` unavailable) | `inventory/multi.ini` | `-e spur_accounting_enabled=false` |
| WireGuard transport (single- or multi-controller) | `inventory/multi.ini` or `inventory/ha.ini` | `-e spur_transport=wireguard` |
| Preserve Raft state on re-deploy (production default) | `inventory/ha.ini` | `-e spur_wipe_state=false` |
| One host only (e.g. re-push config to a single agent) | `inventory/multi.ini` | `--limit gpu-1` |
| Dry-run without applying | `inventory/multi.ini` | `--check --diff` |
| Large fleet, tolerate a few agents being down for maintenance | `inventory/multi.ini` | `-e spur_ignore_unreachable_agents=true` |

---

## Inventory examples

Pick the example that matches your cluster shape and copy it into your inventory file.

### Single-node

```ini
[spur_controllers]
node1 ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root

[spur_agents]
node1 ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root
```

### Multi-node, direct LAN

```ini
[spur_controllers]
ctl ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root

[spur_agents]
ctl   ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root   ; controller also runs an agent (hyperconverged)
gpu-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.11 ansible_user=root
gpu-2 ansible_host=10.0.0.12 ansible_user=root

[all:vars]
spur_transport=direct
```

### Multi-node, WireGuard mesh

```ini
[spur_controllers]
ctl ansible_host=ctl.example.com ansible_user=root

[spur_agents]
gpu-1 ansible_host=gpu1.example.com ansible_user=root
gpu-2 ansible_host=gpu2.example.com ansible_user=root

[all:vars]
spur_transport=wireguard
spur_wg_cidr=10.44.0.0/16
spur_wg_port=51820
```

> WireGuard supports both single- and multi-controller (HA) clusters. The bootstrap controller (first in `spur_controllers`) runs `spur net init` and auto-assigns `.1`; every other node — secondary controllers, agents, and login nodes — joins and auto-assigns `.2`, `.3`, … by position. For HA (>1 controller) a full-mesh pass (`spur net mesh`) then peers every node with every other, including controller↔controller, so Raft elections work over the mesh. Override any host with `spur_wg_address=…`. This needs the `ansible.utils` collection on the control node. See [HA — WireGuard mesh](#ha--wireguard-mesh-multi-controller) below for the multi-controller layout.

### HA — multi-controller Raft (hyperconverged)

```ini
[spur_controllers]
ctl-0 ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root
ctl-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.11 ansible_user=root
ctl-2 ansible_host=10.0.0.12 ansible_user=root   ; 3 → tolerates 1 failure

[spur_agents]
ctl-0 ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root   ; controllers also run agents
ctl-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.11 ansible_user=root
ctl-2 ansible_host=10.0.0.12 ansible_user=root
```

### HA — separate compute (control plane ≠ compute plane)

```ini
[spur_controllers]
ctl-0 ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root
ctl-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.11 ansible_user=root
ctl-2 ansible_host=10.0.0.12 ansible_user=root

[spur_agents]
gpu-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.21 ansible_user=root   ; dedicated compute — no spurctld
gpu-2 ansible_host=10.0.0.22 ansible_user=root
```

### HA — WireGuard mesh (multi-controller)

Combine multi-controller Raft with `spur_transport=wireguard`: the control plane (and Raft) rides an encrypted mesh instead of the LAN. The bootstrap controller runs `net init` (`.1`); the other controllers and all agents join, then `net mesh` peers everyone directly so Raft elections work even if the bootstrap controller is down. See the tracked templates `inventory/hosts.d2ha.example.ini` + `inventory/d2ha.vars.yml`.

```ini
[spur_controllers]
ctl-0 ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.1
ctl-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.11 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.3
ctl-2 ansible_host=10.0.0.12 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.4

[spur_agents]
ctl-0    ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.1   ; controllers also run agents
ctl-1    ansible_host=10.0.0.11 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.3
ctl-2    ansible_host=10.0.0.12 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.4
worker-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.21 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.2
```

> Pass the WireGuard run-vars via `-e @inventory/d2ha.vars.yml` (extra-vars), not inventory `[all:vars]`: `group_vars/all.yml` sets `spur_transport=direct` and outranks inventory group vars, so `spur_transport=wireguard` in `[all:vars]` is silently reverted and the mesh never forms. Pinning `spur_wg_address` per host (as above) is recommended for a fixed, readable layout; leave it unset to auto-assign positionally.

**In HA mode, the playbook:**
- Writes the same `peers = [...]` list to every controller's `spur.conf`. Order matters — don't reorder controllers between deploys without wiping state.
- Assigns `node_id` = the controller's 1-based position in `groups['spur_controllers']`.
- Waits for a leader to be elected before proceeding to agent registration.
- Lets non-leader controllers forward client RPCs to the leader internally, so clients can talk to any controller.

**Always use an odd `N` ≥ 3 in production.** An even `N` gives the same fault tolerance as `N-1` and is strictly worse, and `N=2` has zero fault tolerance (code-path testing only).

**Client-side failover is automatic.** Both `spurd --controller` and the CLI's `SPUR_CONTROLLER_ADDR` accept a comma-separated endpoint list and rotate past a dead one. The playbook therefore points every agent — and each controller's own `/etc/environment` — at *every* controller, not just the first. A single surviving controller is enough, since server-side leader forwarding handles writes from any endpoint in the list. No VIP/DNS round-robin is needed for basic failover.

A full HA inventory template lives at `inventory/hosts.ha.example.ini`.

### HA — WireGuard mesh + SPUR-managed k0s (k8s)

Layer a SPUR-managed k0s cluster on top of the HA mesh. The key thing to understand: **there is no `[k8s_controllers]`/`[k8s_workers]` inventory group.** Every k8s node is first a registered SPUR agent in `[spur_agents]`; the k0s control-plane-vs-worker split is a **runtime CSV** passed to `spur k8s up` via `spur_k8s_control_plane_nodes` / `spur_k8s_nodes`. The k0s control plane is a separate quorum from the SPUR (`spurctld`) controllers — they can be different hosts, as in the template below.

The tracked templates `inventory/hosts.k8sha.example.ini` + `inventory/k8sha.vars.yml` lay out a 20-node cluster (+1 login): 3 SPUR controllers, an HA k0s control plane (3 nodes), 5 k0s workers, 9 plain compute agents, and 1 login node. Every `spur_wg_address` is pinned per host (per-role IP blocks) — the positional auto-assign is not stable once you add/remove nodes, so pinning is recommended for any cluster you'll grow over time.

```ini
[spur_controllers]
ctl-0 ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.1
ctl-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.11 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.2
ctl-2 ansible_host=10.0.0.12 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.3

[spur_agents]
ctl-0    ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.1   ; controllers also run agents
ctl-1    ansible_host=10.0.0.11 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.2
ctl-2    ansible_host=10.0.0.12 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.3
k8s-cp-0 ansible_host=10.0.0.20 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.11  ; k0s HA control plane
k8s-cp-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.21 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.12
k8s-cp-2 ansible_host=10.0.0.22 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.13
k8s-w-0  ansible_host=10.0.0.30 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.21  ; k0s workers
k8s-w-1  ansible_host=10.0.0.31 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.22
; … k8s-w-2..4, then plain compute gpu-0..8 …

[spur_login]
login-0  ansible_host=10.0.0.50 ansible_user=root spur_wg_address=10.44.0.41
```

The paired `k8sha.vars.yml` turns on the mesh and k8s, and defines the control-plane/worker split:

```yaml
spur_transport: wireguard
spur_k8s_enabled: true          # must be true at deploy.yml time (writes the [cluster] section)
spur_k8s_cni: calico            # native routing so pod traffic rides the mesh
spur_k8s_control_plane_nodes: "k8s-cp-0,k8s-cp-1,k8s-cp-2"                        # HA k0s CP (3 → tolerates 1 etcd failure)
spur_k8s_nodes: "k8s-cp-0,k8s-cp-1,k8s-cp-2,k8s-w-0,k8s-w-1,k8s-w-2,k8s-w-3,k8s-w-4"   # scope k0s to CP + workers only
```

Deploy, then bring up k0s (both take the same `-e @…vars.yml`):

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/hosts.k8sha.ini -e @inventory/k8sha.vars.yml
ansible-playbook playbooks/k8s_up.yml -i inventory/hosts.k8sha.ini -e @inventory/k8sha.vars.yml
```

> `spur_k8s_enabled` must be `true` at `deploy.yml` time so `spur.conf` gets the `[cluster]` section — `k8s_up.yml` asserts this and fails fast otherwise. The 9 `gpu-*` compute agents and `login-0` are in the mesh and the SPUR scheduler but deliberately excluded from `spur_k8s_nodes`, so they never run k0s.

---

## Login (submission) nodes

**Optional, off by default.** A login node is a host your users SSH into to submit and query jobs. It runs the `spur` CLI but **no daemon** — no `spurctld`, no `spurd`. To set one up, just add a `[spur_login]` group to your inventory. Leave the group out and nothing happens.

```ini
[spur_controllers]
ctl ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root

[spur_agents]
gpu-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.11 ansible_user=root
gpu-2 ansible_host=10.0.0.12 ansible_user=root

[spur_login]
login1 ansible_host=10.0.0.20 ansible_user=root   ; users SSH here to run sbatch/squeue/sacct/srun
```

On each login node the playbook does three things: installs the `spur` CLI, adds all 18 Slurm symlinks, and writes `SPUR_CONTROLLER_ADDR` (every controller, comma-joined) to `/etc/environment`. Nothing else. Users can then SSH in and run `sbatch`/`squeue`/`sacct`/`srun`/etc. with no per-command flags.

You only need `[spur_login]` for **dedicated** submission hosts. A host already in `[spur_controllers]` or `[spur_agents]` is already a client, so there's no need to list it here.

**Networking.** A login node needs outbound access to:

- the controllers on `6817` — used for all CLI commands and accounting.
- the agents on `6818` — used for interactive `srun` live output, which streams job output directly from the agent.

Batch `sbatch` needs only the controller. Under `spur_transport=wireguard`, login nodes are automatically joined to the mesh, so all of this works over the tunnel.

---

## Accounting (PostgreSQL, embedded in spurctld)

Accounting is on by default (`spur_accounting_enabled: true`), and there's no separate accounting daemon to manage. Upstream folded the old standalone `spurdbd` into `spurctld`, which now serves the `SlurmAccounting` gRPC service in-process on its own controller port (6817) whenever `[accounting].database_url` is set. The only distinct service is Postgres itself, which runs on **`spur_accounting_host`** (default: the first controller).

Before the controllers start, the `spur_accounting` role:

1. Installs `postgresql` + `postgresql-contrib`.
2. Creates the `spur` role and `spur` database idempotently.
3. Configures Postgres to accept remote TCP connections from every controller's IP (via `listen_addresses` and `pg_hba.conf`). Each controller's embedded accounting service connects to Postgres over the network — not just the one that happens to be co-located with it.
4. Writes an `[accounting]` block into every controller's `spur.conf`, pointing `database_url` at that host.

**Dedicated accounting node.** To run Postgres on its own host — not a controller or agent — add that host to a `[spur_accounting_node]` group in your inventory. That's all it takes: the playbook auto-detects the group and runs Postgres there. The host needs no spur binaries, since only Postgres runs on it.

```ini
[spur_controllers]
ctl ansible_host=10.0.0.10 ansible_user=root

[spur_agents]
gpu-1 ansible_host=10.0.0.11 ansible_user=root

[spur_accounting_node]
acct-0 ansible_host=10.0.0.20 ansible_user=root   ; Postgres only, no spur daemons
```

Deploy exactly as usual — no accounting-specific flag needed:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini
```

The accounting host is resolved in this order: an explicit `spur_accounting_host` → the first host in `[spur_accounting_node]` → the first controller (the co-located default). So the group alone is enough to pin a dedicated node.

**Pointing accounting at a specific host instead.** To use an existing host without adding a group — say a particular controller or agent — set `spur_accounting_host` (it takes highest precedence). Pass it with `-e`:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_accounting_host=acct-0
```

Every controller connects to the accounting host over the network; the role opens `listen_addresses`/`pg_hba.conf` for each controller's IP. If the host's PostgreSQL isn't on the default port, pass `-e spur_accounting_db_port=<port>`.

On every managed host (controllers, agents, login nodes), the playbook writes `SPUR_CONTROLLER_ADDR` (listing every controller) to `/etc/environment`. This means the whole CLI works everywhere with no per-command flags — `squeue`/`sinfo`/`scontrol` and `sacct`/`sacctmgr`/`sreport`/`sshare` alike. Accounting rides the same address; there's no separate env var for it anymore. On a host outside the managed inventory, or to override, set it yourself:

```bash
export SPUR_CONTROLLER_ADDR=http://<a-controller>:6817[,http://<another>:6817,...]
```

Job submission still works without accounting — pass `-e spur_accounting_enabled=false` (shown in [Quick start](#quick-start)). You'll only lose `sacct` and fairshare.

> Default DB credentials are `spur`/`spur`/`spur` — fine for a lab, but **change `spur_accounting_db_password` for anything real.**

**Upgrading a pre-merge deployment.** If a cluster is still running the old, separate `spurdbd` (check with `systemctl is-active spurdbd`, or look for an `[accounting] host = ...` line in `spur.conf`), just re-run `deploy.yml` pointed at a merged-architecture build. `spur_accounting` stops, disables, and removes any leftover `spurdbd` unit and binary, reconfigures Postgres for remote access, and the regenerated `spur.conf` drops the old `host` key — no manual cleanup needed. Note that this is a full-cluster convergence, not a rolling upgrade (see [Upgrading](#upgrading)), so expect a brief restart of every daemon.

## Variables (defaults in `inventory/group_vars/all.yml`)

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `spur_cluster_name` | `spur-cluster` | Sets `cluster_name` in `spur.conf`. |
| `spur_binary_src` | *(unset)* | Local dir of pre-built binaries to push. Leave unset to fetch via upstream `install.sh`. |
| `spur_version` | `latest` | Which `install.sh` channel to pull: `latest` / `nightly` / `vX.Y.Z`. |
| `spur_install_dir` | `/root/.local/bin` | Where binaries and Slurm symlinks land (added to `/etc/environment`). |
| `spur_home` | `/root/spur` | Per-host root for state, logs, and config. |
| `spur_agent_state_dir` | `{{ spur_home }}/agent-state` | Each agent's own runtime state — the `spurstepd` sessions a restarted `spurd` re-adopts. Passed to `spurd` as `SPUR_STEPD_STATE_DIR`. Kept out of `{{ spur_home }}/state` (the controller's Raft dir) so a host running both daemons never shares one. |
| `spur_require_stepd` | `false` | Treat a missing `spurstepd` as a hard failure in `spur_install` and a reported problem in `healthcheck.yml`. Default `false` because builds that predate it ship none; set `true` on a cluster whose build does. |
| `spur_mpi_plugin_dir` | `/usr/lib/spur` | Where `spur_mpi_pmix.so` is installed on agents (matches `spurd` default). |
| `spur_mpi_plugin_enabled` | `true` | Install the MPI plugin on agents when a source file is available. |
| `spur_transport` | `direct` | Network transport: `direct` or `wireguard`. |
| `spur_accounting_enabled` | `true` | Deploy PostgreSQL accounting (embedded in spurctld). Set `false` to skip. |
| `spur_accounting_host` | first controller | Host that runs Postgres (any managed host). Pass via `-e`. |
| `spur_accounting_db_name` / `_user` / `_password` | `spur` / `spur` / `spur` | Accounting DB credentials. |
| `spur_accounting_db_port` | `5432` | Postgres listen port. |
| `spur_wg_cidr` / `spur_wg_port` / `spur_wg_interface` | `10.44.0.0/16` / `51820` / `spur0` | WireGuard mesh settings. |
| `spur_controller_port` / `spur_agent_port` / `spur_raft_port` | `6817` / `6818` / `6821` | Daemon listen ports. |
| `spur_log_level` | `info` | Daemon log verbosity. |
| `spur_wipe_state` | `false` | Wipe `~/spur/state` (Raft job queue/registrations) on (re)deploy. Safe default for re-runs and upgrades; set `true` for a fresh install or intentional Raft reinit. |
| `spur_force_reinstall` | `false` | Re-pull/re-copy binaries via `spur_install` even if already present. Used by `rolling_upgrade.yml`. |
| `spur_rolling_batch_size` | `1` | Agents upgraded per batch in `rolling_upgrade.yml` (`serial`). Controllers always upgrade one at a time regardless. |
| `spur_controller_upgrade_order` | inventory order | Comma-separated controller names — upgrade them in this order instead of `[spur_controllers]`'s inventory order. Must name every controller exactly once; `rolling_upgrade.yml` fails fast otherwise. |
| `spur_ignore_unreachable_agents` | `false` | Skip agents unreachable over SSH instead of aborting — `deploy.yml`, `rolling_upgrade.yml`, `healthcheck.yml`, `teardown.yml`, `add_nodes.yml`, `remove_nodes.yml`. Never loosens controller/accounting-host reachability. |
| `spur_verify_enabled` | `false` | Submit and wait for a real test job at the end of `deploy.yml` / `rolling_upgrade.yml` (`spur_verify` role). Off by default to avoid job noise on routine runs; CI enables it as a smoke test. |
| `spur_verify_submit_user` | *(unset — submits as the play's own user)* | Submit the verify role's test job as this user instead. Needed if the cluster's `spurd` rejects uid-0 job submission (`[auth] allow_root_jobs=false`), which newer builds default to. |
| `spur_gather_subset` | `['!all', network, hardware, distribution]` | Facts subset gathered by every `gather_facts: yes` play. Restricts Ansible's default full gather (every mount/PCI device/interface) to just what the roles use. Set `-e spur_gather_subset=all` to fall back to full gathering. |
| `spur_overwrite_conf` | `false` | Overwrite an existing `spur.conf` (controller or agent) instead of leaving it alone. Same default across every playbook, including `add_nodes.yml` — a newly added node registers live either way, but only appears in the rendered `[[nodes]]` block on a run (this one or a later `deploy.yml`/`rolling_upgrade.yml`) that passes this flag. |
| `spur_drain_wait_secs` | `120` | How long to wait for a node to reach `DRAINED`/`DOWN` before treating it as busy — used by `deploy.yml`, `rolling_upgrade.yml`, and (only if draining was requested) `teardown.yml` via the shared drain task, plus `remove_nodes.yml`'s own separate inline drain-wait logic. `rolling_upgrade.yml`'s force/trust-stepd modes check once instead of waiting — the controller flips `Draining`->`Drain` synchronously off job completion, so there's nothing to wait out. |
| `spur_controller_stop_timeout_secs` | `15` | `spurctld` systemd unit's `TimeoutStopSec` — bounds how long a stop/restart/rolling-upgrade waits for a stuck/slow shutdown (e.g. a live `srun` step, see SPUR-304) before SIGKILL, instead of systemd's own ~90s default. |
| `spur_skip_busy_agents` | `false` | Leave a still-busy node untouched and continue with the rest of the fleet, instead of the playbook's default (refuse, or force for `deploy.yml`). Shared task in `deploy.yml`/`rolling_upgrade.yml`; `remove_nodes.yml` reads the same variable in its own inline logic. On `teardown.yml` (disruptive/no-drain by default), setting this is also what opts back into draining first. |
| `spur_force_teardown_busy_agents` | `false` | `teardown.yml`-specific: opts into draining first (like `spur_skip_busy_agents` above), then kills a busy node's running job and tears it down anyway. |
| `spur_force_upgrade_busy_agents` | `false` | `rolling_upgrade.yml`-specific: kill a busy node's running job and upgrade it anyway. |
| `spur_trust_stepd_busy_agents` | `false` | `rolling_upgrade.yml`-specific: restart a busy node's `spurd` without killing its running job, trusting `spurstepd` to carry it across. Refused if the node has no `spurstepd` yet, or combined with `spur_skip_busy_agents`/`spur_force_upgrade_busy_agents`. |
| `spur_force_remove_busy_nodes` | `false` | `remove_nodes.yml`-specific: kill a busy node's running job and remove it anyway. |

Override any of these per run with `-e key=value` (repeatable):

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_binary_src=/path/to/target/release -e spur_wipe_state=true
```

The day-2 admin playbooks take their own inputs — `spur_accounts` / `spur_qos` / `spur_users` for `manage_accounts.yml`, `new_nodes` for `add_nodes.yml`, `nodes_to_remove` for `remove_nodes.yml`. Those are per-playbook inputs rather than global cluster settings, so they live under [Admin operations](#admin-operations) instead of the table above.

## Upgrading

Two ways to roll out newer binaries. Pick based on whether the cluster can take a full-daemon bounce or needs to keep running jobs throughout.

| Path | Use when | Downtime |
|---|---|---|
| Full convergence (`deploy.yml`) | You're changing the topology, or a short cluster-wide blip is fine | Every daemon restarts at once |
| Rolling upgrade (`rolling_upgrade.yml`) | The cluster is live with running jobs and must stay up | One host at a time |

### Full convergence (`deploy.yml`) — simplest, brief outage

This is the simplest path. It's non-destructive by default: `spur_wipe_state=false` preserves job state and registrations. The catch is that it restarts **every** daemon on **every** host in the same play, with no batching, and in HA all controllers bounce together and briefly lose the Raft leader.

Reach for it when you're making a topology change — migrating off `spurdbd`, adding or removing hosts — or when a short full-cluster blip is acceptable.

An already-registered agent with a job still running is drained first; if it's still busy afterward, its job is killed and the restart proceeds anyway — full convergence is the point of this playbook. Opt out with `-e spur_skip_busy_agents=true` to leave busy agents untouched instead and deploy the rest of the fleet:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_skip_busy_agents=true   # leave busy agents untouched, deploy the rest
```

Agents get their own `spur.conf` too — a minimal one with cluster identity and the `[cluster]`/k0s block, not the controller's full file. On both controllers and agents, a missing `spur.conf` is always written; an existing one is left alone unless you pass `-e spur_overwrite_conf=true`.

```bash
cargo build --release -p spur-cli -p spurctld -p spurd -p spur-stepd   # rebuild all of them together, see caveat below
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_binary_src=/path/to/target/release
```

A few things worth knowing:

- **Binaries roll out by content, not version string.** Ansible compares checksums, so an unchanged re-run is a near no-op.
- **Rebuild all of them together.** They share a Raft WAL schema. Mixing binaries from different builds — say, rebuilding only `spurctld` — can leave a controller unable to parse a log a differently-versioned peer wrote. `spurd` and `spurstepd` are even tighter: a supervisor written by one build is not adopted by another, so those two must always come from the same build. The role copies them in the same task for that reason.
- **HA topology changes are guarded.** Adding, removing, or reordering a **controller** needs a reinit. Spur 0.3.0 has no online Raft membership change, so the role fails early with an actionable message if you change the controller set without `-e spur_wipe_state=true`. **Compute agents aren't Raft members** — add or remove them freely, no wipe needed.
- **Demoting a controller to agent-only leaves a stale `spurctld`.** Moving a host out of `[spur_controllers]`? Run `systemctl disable --now spurctld` on it first. Otherwise the leftover daemon keeps the old membership and can block quorum.

### Rolling upgrade (`rolling_upgrade.yml`) — for a live cluster with running jobs

This path upgrades one host at a time, so the cluster keeps scheduling and running jobs throughout.

```bash
cargo build --release -p spur-cli -p spurctld -p spurd -p spur-stepd
ansible-playbook playbooks/rolling_upgrade.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_binary_src=/path/to/target/release
```

It reuses the same `spur_install`/`spur_controller`/`spur_agent`/`spur_verify` roles that `deploy.yml` uses, so there's no duplicated install, config, or health-check logic. Here's what it does, in order:

1. **Guard rail.** Refuses to start if `spur_wipe_state=true`, if `spur_transport=wireguard` (this playbook doesn't support it yet), or if the cluster isn't already healthy (leader elected, `spur nodes` reachable).
2. **Controllers, one at a time** (`serial: 1`; the whole run aborts on the first failure). For each: force-reinstall, restart `spurctld`, then wait on the existing HA-aware "wait for Raft leader" task as the health gate before moving to the next controller. Client-side failover keeps the rest serving while one is down, since every agent and CLI is pointed at *every* controller.
3. **Agents, in configurable batches** (`spur_rolling_batch_size`, default `1`). For each node: `spur node drain <node>`, poll until `DRAINED` (once no running jobs are left), force-reinstall, restart `spurd`, wait for re-registration, then `scontrol update NodeName=<node> State=RESUME`.
4. **Verify** *(opt-in — `-e spur_verify_enabled=true`)*. Submits a real test job at the end to confirm the upgraded cluster actually schedules work. Off by default so routine upgrades don't add job noise; CI enables it.

The same rebuild-everything-together caveat from full convergence applies here too. `spurstepd` is installed/upgraded on agents the same way `spur`/`spurctld`/`spurd` are — no special handling, though the run prints an informational note (not a refusal) the first time it lands on an agent, since the controllers ahead of it in the batch are already on the new build.

`spur_rolling_batch_size` trades speed for blast radius. The default `1` disrupts at most one agent's capacity at a time; a higher value upgrades faster but drains more capacity concurrently.

Controllers upgrade in inventory order by default. To upgrade them in a specific order instead — say, a known-stable Raft leader first — pass `-e spur_controller_upgrade_order=ctl-2,ctl-0,ctl-1`. It must name every controller in `[spur_controllers]` exactly once; the guard-rail play fails fast (before touching any host) if a name is missing, misspelled, or duplicated.

#### Busy-node handling — pick exactly one mode

A still-busy node is one whose running job didn't drain within `spur_drain_wait_secs` (default `120s`). By default the run just aborts there. Three flags change that, **each a full alternative strategy — set at most one; the guard-rail play fails fast if you set more than one**. Force and trust-stepd already commit to proceeding either way, so neither waits out the full window: force checks busy status once, immediately after issuing the drain (a false-busy read there only costs a harmless extra kill sweep); trust-stepd gives it a brief bounded retry instead of one shot, since a false-busy read on a node with no `spurstepd` yet would otherwise abort the whole run. Only refuse/skip need the full window, since for them the busy/not-busy answer changes what actually happens:

| Mode | Flag | What happens to the busy node | What happens to its running job |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Refuse** *(default — no flag)* | *(none)* | Left on the old build; the **whole run aborts** | Untouched, keeps running |
| **Skip** | `spur_skip_busy_agents=true` | Left on the old build; rest of the fleet still upgrades | Untouched, keeps running |
| **Force** | `spur_force_upgrade_busy_agents=true` | Upgraded to the new build immediately | **Killed** (`NODE_FAIL`) the moment `spurd` restarts |
| **Trust spurstepd** | `spur_trust_stepd_busy_agents=true` | Upgraded to the new build immediately | Untouched, keeps running (see below) |

```bash
# Force: kill the running job, upgrade the node anyway
ansible-playbook playbooks/rolling_upgrade.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_binary_src=/path -e spur_force_upgrade_busy_agents=true

# Non-disruptive: upgrade the node WITHOUT killing its running job
ansible-playbook playbooks/rolling_upgrade.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_binary_src=/path -e spur_trust_stepd_busy_agents=true

# Skip: leave the busy node on its old build, upgrade the rest of the fleet
ansible-playbook playbooks/rolling_upgrade.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_binary_src=/path -e spur_skip_busy_agents=true
```

**`spur_trust_stepd_busy_agents=true` (non-disruptive) upgrades a busy node's `spurd` without touching its running job.** `spurstepd` is a detached, double-forked supervisor outside `spurd`'s process lifecycle (see [spurstepd](#spurstepd-the-job-supervisor)) — a job it supervises keeps running, in its own cgroup, across a `spurd` restart, and the restarted agent re-adopts it. This flag skips the wait-then-abort/kill choice entirely for a node whose job is already `spurstepd`-supervised: `spurd` restarts, the new binary discovers and reconciles the live session, and the job is never interrupted. It still falls back to the default refusal on a node with no `spurstepd` installed yet — trusting a supervisor that isn't there would be unsafe. This does not affect scheduling of *new* jobs: the node is still drained (and only resumed once the upgrade completes), so nothing new lands on it mid-swap.

> A single-controller cluster has no other controller to fail over to during its own restart, so rolling it is still a short outage. Real zero-downtime needs HA — three or more controllers.

**Force-upgrading a busy node cleans up its `spurstepd` on its own, no explicit reap needed.** `spur_force_upgrade_busy_agents=true` kills the node's job processes (same cgroup sweep as everywhere else) but deliberately leaves any `spurstepd` supervising them alone — same reasoning as the [job supervisor](#spurstepd-the-job-supervisor) section above: the supervisor notices the kill almost immediately and tears down the job's cgroup as part of handling it, well before `spur_agent` even gets to restarting `spurd` below. Its on-disk completion record is deliberately kept until the controller has actually acknowledged the report, though — not torn down alongside the cgroup — so if `spurd` itself gets restarted before that report lands, its own startup recovery finds the record and retries the report, closing the job out correctly instead of leaving it stuck `RUNNING`. No separate `reap_stepd_supervisors.yml` call required either way, unlike `teardown.yml`/`remove_nodes.yml`, which stop `spurd` and leave it stopped with no restart to ever trigger that recovery. This playbook has no wipe flag (unlike `teardown.yml -e wipe=true`), so anything else under `spur_agent_state_dir` is left untouched.

---

## Managing the cluster after deploy

The daemons are ordinary systemd services, so manage them with the usual tools on any host:

```bash
systemctl status spurctld          # on a controller (also serves accounting when enabled)
systemctl status spurd             # on an agent
systemctl status postgresql        # on the accounting host
journalctl -u spurctld -f          # follow logs
```

The binaries are on your `PATH` (via `/etc/environment`), so the everyday cluster commands just work:

```bash
spur nodes        # partition/node summary
spur queue        # job queue
spur submit job.sh
sacct             # accounting (when enabled) — Slurm-compatible symlink to spur
```

---

## Admin operations

These are the day-2 playbooks for routine cluster administration. All of them are safe to run against a live cluster.

### Manage accounts / users / QoS — `manage_accounts.yml`

Declaratively apply accounting entities — QoS, accounts, and users. This is a runtime-only operation: it talks to the controller's embedded accounting through `sacctmgr`, so there's **no restart and no disruption**. It's also idempotent, since `sacctmgr add` upserts. Define the desired state in a group_vars file, or pass it with `-e`:

```yaml
# e.g. inventory/group_vars/all.yml (or a dedicated accounts.yml)
spur_qos:
  - { name: high, priority: 100, maxwall: 1440 }
spur_accounts:
  - { name: research, description: "Research group", fairshare: 100 }
  - { name: ml, parent: research, fairshare: 50 }
spur_users:
  - { name: alice, account: ml, defaultaccount: ml }
```

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/manage_accounts.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini
```

To remove entities, list them under `spur_qos_absent` / `spur_accounts_absent` / `spur_users_absent` (name-only; users also take `account`). The playbook applies everything in FK-safe order automatically: qos/accounts before users when adding, and users before accounts when removing. That ordering matters because an account can't be deleted while a user association still references it. Requires accounting enabled.

### Add compute nodes — `add_nodes.yml`

Add agent(s) to a **running** cluster with **no disruption to existing daemons or jobs**. A full `deploy.yml` run also adds nodes, but it restarts every spurctld and spurd (see [Upgrading](#upgrading)); `add_nodes.yml` only starts `spurd` on the new hosts. This works because a new `spurd` registers itself at runtime — the node shows up in `spur nodes` immediately, with no controller restart.

First add the host(s) to `[spur_agents]` in your inventory (the source of truth), then run:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/add_nodes.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e new_nodes=gpu-3,gpu-4
```

What it does: installs and starts `spurd` on the new hosts only, and verifies that each new node registered. It's idempotent — a node that's already registered is skipped, so re-runs never bounce a healthy agent. Adding a **controller** is out of scope, because that's a Raft membership change; use `deploy.yml` for that. `add_nodes.yml` refuses controller names.

Like every other playbook, an existing `spur.conf` on the controllers is left alone by default — the new node is already live-registered (schedulable immediately) regardless of the file. Facts (cpu/memory) are gathered across the cluster on every run regardless of this flag, since the WireGuard mesh-join play needs them too; pass `-e spur_overwrite_conf=true` to also refresh `spur.conf` with the new node's entry, still **without restarting** the controller:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/add_nodes.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e new_nodes=gpu-3,gpu-4 -e spur_overwrite_conf=true
```

On a **WireGuard** cluster it joins the new node to the mesh before starting `spurd`, and meshes it with every existing member (controllers, agents, and login nodes) so it's fully peered — not just to the controllers. An unrelated existing member being down doesn't abort the add when `-e spur_ignore_unreachable_agents=true` is set. The new node must have a `spur_wg_address` (pinned in inventory, or auto-assigned by position).

### Decommission compute nodes — `remove_nodes.yml`

Cleanly remove agents from a running cluster. The playbook drains each node, waits until it reaches `DRAINED` so running jobs finish first, stops `spurd` on the node, reaps any job supervisor and session state still there, then runs `spur node remove`. There's no Raft state wipe, since agents aren't Raft members.

The supervisor reap matters because a `spurstepd` deliberately outlives its agent, so "stop `spurd`" does not stop it. On a cleanly drained node there is nothing left to reap and the step is a no-op; on a forced removal it is what keeps the decommissioned host from running processes for a cluster it no longer belongs to. The node is going away and nothing will ever re-adopt its sessions, so those are deleted too.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/remove_nodes.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e nodes_to_remove=gpu-3,gpu-4
```

Use the names as they appear in `spur nodes`. Afterward, **delete those hosts from `[spur_agents]` in your inventory** — otherwise a later `deploy.yml` will re-add them. The playbook prints this reminder when it finishes.

On a **WireGuard** cluster it also tears down the removed node's mesh interface and drops its WG peer from **every surviving mesh member** — controllers, other agents, and login nodes — so it doesn't linger as a ghost peer (in a full mesh every node peered it). An unrelated agent being down doesn't block the removal when `-e spur_ignore_unreachable_agents=true` is set.

A node with a job still running does not finish draining — same job-safety model as `deploy.yml`/`rolling_upgrade.yml`. By default the run aborts before removing anything:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/remove_nodes.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e nodes_to_remove=gpu-3,gpu-4 -e spur_skip_busy_agents=true         # remove only the nodes that drained cleanly, leave busy ones in the cluster
ansible-playbook playbooks/remove_nodes.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e nodes_to_remove=gpu-3,gpu-4 -e spur_force_remove_busy_nodes=true   # kill the running job and remove it anyway
```

### Health check — `healthcheck.yml`

Read-only cluster diagnostics. It checks that daemons are active, the controller is reachable with a leader elected, accounting/Postgres is up, agent ports are listening, and disk/Raft-state size is healthy. With `-e spur_require_stepd=true` it also checks that `spurstepd` is installed beside `spurd` on every agent — off by default so a cluster on a build that predates it isn't reported unhealthy. It never changes anything. If something's wrong it exits non-zero with a per-host problem list, which makes it usable as a cron or monitoring probe.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/healthcheck.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini
ansible-playbook playbooks/healthcheck.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_ignore_unreachable_agents=true  # skip unreachable agents instead of aborting
```

> **Partitions** aren't manageable this way yet. Spur has no runtime partition CLI (unlike Slurm's `scontrol create/update/delete partition`), so partition changes still mean editing the `[[partitions]]` blocks in the controller role's `spur.conf` template and re-running `deploy.yml`, which involves a brief controller restart. This is tracked upstream as a Spur feature request.

---

## Tear down

Two flavors — the plain one stops the cluster, the `wipe=true` one also erases per-host state:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/teardown.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini              # stop + disable daemons, remove units
ansible-playbook playbooks/teardown.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e wipe=true  # also rm -rf ~/spur and /etc/wireguard/spur0.conf
ansible-playbook playbooks/teardown.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_ignore_unreachable_agents=true  # skip unreachable agents instead of aborting
```

Either way it stops and disables the systemd services and reaps any stray daemons — **including the job supervisors**. A `spurstepd` is built to outlive its agent (its own session, reparented to init, and spared by the unit's `KillMode=process`), so stopping `spurd` leaves it running; teardown kills it explicitly, after the job-cgroup sweep and after the daemons are down. That ordering is deliberate: a supervisor whose workload just died reports that exit, so killing it first would throw the completion away. Session state on disk is left alone unless `-e wipe=true`, so a teardown you meant to undo still can be. On a **WireGuard** cluster it also brings the mesh interface down and disables its `wg-quick@<iface>` boot unit, so a plain (non-wipe) teardown doesn't silently re-establish the mesh on the next reboot; `-e wipe=true` additionally removes the saved `/etc/wireguard/<iface>.conf`. It deliberately leaves PostgreSQL installed and your accounting database intact — so if you want those gone too, drop them by hand on the accounting host.

If `spur_k8s_enabled=true`, teardown first tears down any Spur-managed k0s cluster with a full `k0s reset` on every node (`spur k8s down --reset`) and waits for it to finish, before any Spur daemon is stopped — a node's k0s component can only be reset via a controller -> agent RPC, which needs both sides still running. Nothing k0s-related happens when `spur_k8s_enabled` is unset/false. This step targets specifically the first controller in inventory — running with `--limit` in a way that excludes that one host (even if other controllers are included, in HA setups) skips it silently and leaves agents' k0s components un-reset.

Disruptive by default, with no drain step: teardown means the whole cluster is coming down, so there's no surviving fleet left to protect by draining agents first. To take a node out of a cluster that keeps running (draining it first so its job finishes), use `remove_nodes.yml` instead.

An agent with a job still running is stopped immediately by default — including any Docker/Podman container the job launched, via the same cgroup sweep `rolling_upgrade.yml --force` uses; only the wait-for-drain step is skipped, not cleanup. Pass either busy-agent flag to opt back into draining it first — if it doesn't finish draining, that host is left running rather than silently killing the job:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/teardown.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_skip_busy_agents=true            # drain first; leave busy agents running, tear down the rest
ansible-playbook playbooks/teardown.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -e spur_force_teardown_busy_agents=true   # drain first; kill the running job and tear it down anyway
```

```bash
sudo -u postgres dropdb spur
sudo -u postgres dropuser spur
```

## Troubleshooting

A field guide to things you might see while running or operating a cluster — most of the scary-looking ones are harmless.

| Symptom | What's going on |
|---|---|
| `spurctld` logs an `ERROR` on restart — `Can not initialize last_log_id=... vote=...:committed` | Harmless — normal on any restart with existing Raft state. Judge health from `spur nodes` / jobs / `sacct`, not this line. |
| `spurd` logs `failed to load spur.conf` on startup | `spurd` loads `spur.conf` best-effort for the `[cluster]` (SPUR-managed k0s) and `[devices]` (GPU/GRES) sections; everything else it needs (controller, node name, ports) comes from CLI flags. This role writes agents their own minimal `spur.conf` with cluster identity and `[cluster]` (not the controller's full file), so this should only appear if that write itself failed — check disk space/permissions on `{{ spur_home }}/etc`. |
| `invalid transition from Completed to Completed` after a multi-node job | Harmless — a follower's redundant terminal-state report, rejected by the leader. The job succeeded. |
| `spur nodes` shows fewer rows than I have hosts | It collapses by partition — the NODES column is a count, not one row per host. Use `spur show node <name>` to check a specific host. |
| Playbook fails during the accounting apt install with a dpkg-lock error | Another `apt`/unattended-upgrade is running. Wait for it to finish (don't force-clear the lock unless `apt-get` is genuinely hung). |
| Can't find a job's output file | It lands in the job's working directory as `spur-<JOBID>.out`, on **whichever agent ran it** (no shared-FS assumption). Default working dir is `{{ spur_home }}`. |
| `spur --version` errors | Not a supported flag — use `spur nodes` / `spur show ...` to confirm the CLI works. |
| Job IDs restarted at 1 and old `sacct` history looks overwritten | You deployed with `spur_wipe_state=true`, which resets the Raft job-id counter. Use `spur_wipe_state=false` (the default) to preserve history. |

**Ports** the cluster listens on — open these between hosts: `6817` controller API + accounting, `6818` agents, `6821` Raft. `6821` is fixed in Spur 0.3.0.

Curious **why the roles are written the way they are**? The implementation rationale, plus the hard-won Ansible/Spur quirks baked into the tasks, lives in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — that's maintainer reference, not something you need to deploy.
